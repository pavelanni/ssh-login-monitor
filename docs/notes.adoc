= SSH login monitor
Development notes

2023-05-29::
My first implementation was reading from the `/var/log/secure` file which keeps ssh login and logout events in Red Hat 8.
Then I added ability to read from the `systemd` journal similar to `journalctl`.
After looking at Fedora and RHEL 9 implementations it is obvious that reading from journal should be the main option.
Neither Fedora nor RHEL 9 use `/var/log/secure` to log ssh events.

This is a good read about The Journal: https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1IC9yOXj7j6cdLLxWEBAGRL6wl97tFxgjLUEHIX3MSTs/pub
which I found on this blog: http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/the-journal.html which I found in the `/var/log/README` file on
a RHEL 9.2 installation.

In my today's implementation I read the message from the journal, generate a string similar to `/var/log/secure` and parse it.
It seems that it's not the right way. Learning more...
