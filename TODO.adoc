* [*] Use a database for fingerprints. BoltDB (or its BBolt reincarnation) might be a good choice
* [ ] For database use: add functions to add and delete fingerprints from the DB; both manual and batch
* [*] Generate fingerprints inside the app: take usernames and public keys as an input. Maybe read them from `authorized_keys`.
* [ ] Check if logout time is later than login time for a session with the same port number
* [ ] Mark and include in the report logouts without logins and logins without logouts
* [ ] Think about storing fingerprints in LDAP
* [ ] What if I have multiple servers? How to collect login events from many servers and check against a shared fingerprint database? (Has anybody created this already? I guess so...)
