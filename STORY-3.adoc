== Describe the problem

I opened the ChatGPT window and typed the problem description.

image::problem.png[The problem description]

I added the log (here is just a fragment).

image::log.png[Log fragment]

And finally I added the `authorized_keys` file.

image::keys.png[Authorized keys]

Let's see what it can do with such a problem!

I didn't wait for too long.
Almost immediately, ChatGPT started printing.
(The GPT-4 version prints a bit slower that GPT-3.5 and that creates an effect of "thinking".
Also, it reminds me those old teletype machines used with _really_ old computers.)

image::fingerprint_calc.png[Fingerprint calculation]

Wait, what?? It's just a language model!
How could it calculate the fingerprints??

But I didn't have time to answer my own question because ChatGPT continued printing.

image::login_events.png[Login events]

Well, it found the login events based on the string I gave it (him? her?) and connected the fingerprints to those it just calculated.
Impressive. It even found the timestamps and correctly presented them as timestamps.
Good job, but that's easy.

Let's continue and ask about logout events.

image::logout_events_problem.png[Logout events problem]

Again, almost without a pause:

image::logout_events.png[Logout events]

Good logic, great explanation! Find the ports and connect them to the login events.
That means it remembers the login events from the previous task somehow!
Mind blowing... But let's continue.

If it remembers login and logout events, it should be able to calculate session durations.
Or not? Again, it's just a language model, it should not know how to do arithmetics.
Let's ask and see...

image::session_durations.png[Session durations]

Wow! It even explained how it did the calculations! "Show your work," as we were told in school.

I found myself sitting with a dropped jaw a few seconds later.
(No, it's not just a figure of speech. Literally.)

For a few minutes I couldn't collect my thoughts.
Yes, it's a language model. Yes, it can find certain phrases and connect them together because
it has seen those phrases and words many times during training.
I understand that.

But how can it find numbers (like port numbers) and connect them together?
And how can it calculate?
Not only something simple like "37 - 34", but an _SSH public key fingerprint_??
I can't imagine that the model was trained on all possible public keys and their fingerprints, can you?

After several minutes of shock I got another great idea.
I had to close the loop.

image::write_program.png[Write a program]

It wrote a piece of Go code, gave me instructions on how to run it, and how to pass
the input files to it.

Needless to say that I copied the code into my editor and ran it!

One minor thing -- it didn't get the current year.
But it wasn't in the log, so this is fine.
Now I'm pretty sure I could tell it to use the current year if it's missing and it would do it perfectly.
No doubt.
